## Notes on Dutch food

### Introduction

I am staying for ten weeks, from mid-June to mid-August, in eastern Netherlands, while interning for a company in Herveld, Gelderland. 

The region is a famous producer of fruit - apples, cherries, strawberries; I have also seen potatoes and asparagus for sale.

There are greenhouses everywhere in the Netherlands, and food seems quite cheap. Except for good cheese, and possibly some meat.

But there is a lot of bad food available in the supermarket as well - big bags of frozen french fries, or processed meat bitterballs.

The country is rich in fruits and vegetables, and has a very large meat and dairy farms - with cows, sheep and chickens mainly.

### Dutch cuisine

"Traditionally, Dutch cuisine is simple and straightforward, with many vegetables and little meat; breakfast and lunch are typically bread with toppings while dinner is meat and potatoes, supplemented with seasonal vegetables."

"In the twentieth century, the new availability of mass education meant that a great number of girls could be sent to a new school type, the Huishoudschool (housekeeping school), where young women were trained to become domestic servants and where lessons in cooking cheap and simple meals were a major part of the curriculum, often based on more traditional Dutch dishes, and leading to increased uniformity in the Dutch diet. Values taught in that school system included frugality, proper (table) manners, and healthy eating."
